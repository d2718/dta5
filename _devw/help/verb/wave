WAVE supports the following seven syntaxes:

> WAVE
> WAVE <direction>
> WAVE WTIH <my thing>
> WAVE <thing>
> WAVE <direction> WITH <my thing>
> WAVE IN|ON|BEHIND|UNDER <thing>
> WAVE <thing> with <my thing>

Each of these syntaxes should cause you to wave (or wave <my thing>) in the desired fashion.

See also POINT, which functions identically.
