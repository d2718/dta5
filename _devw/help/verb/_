This help topic provides help on the functions and syntax of the various verbs.

The vast majority of verbs in the game requires one of the following syntaxes:

> <verb>
For example:
> LOOK

> <verb> <direct object>
For example:
> LOOK TREE

> <verb> <preposition> <indirect object>
For example:
> LOOK ON WOODEN TABLE

> <verb> <direct object> <preposition> <indirect object>
For example:
> LOOK SILVER CUP ON WOODEN TABLE

Not all verbs use all of these syntaxes (INVENTORY, for example), and some verbs don't uses these syntaxes at all (like SAY).
