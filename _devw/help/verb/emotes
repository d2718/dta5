There are several "emotive" verbs which do not do anything mechanically, but are nonetheless a way for your character to express itself. They all have the same set of syntaxes:

> <verb>
> <verb> <direction>
> <verb> <thing>
> <verb> <thing> IN|ON|BEHIND|UNDER <other thing>

A small bit of harmless experimentation should make the results clear.

The emotive verbs thus far are

BLINK CHUCKLE GAZE FROWN GLANCE GRIN LEAN NOD RAISE SHRUG SIGH SNEER SNICKER SQUINT WINK
