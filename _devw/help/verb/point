POINT supports the following seven syntaxes:

> POINT
> POINT <direction>
> POINT WTIH <my thing>
> POINT <thing>
> POINT <direction> WITH <my thing>
> POINT IN|ON|BEHIND|UNDER <thing>
> POINT <thing> with <my thing>

Each of these syntaxes should cause you to point (or point <my thing>) in the desired fashion.

See also WAVE, which functions identically.
