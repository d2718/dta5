["r101", "You stand in an underground service tunnel that runs north-south. In places the walls are natural stone; in others, they are reinforced with roughly-poured concrete. Many places down here look permanently damp, and a trickle of water makes its sluggish way north along the center of the floor. The tunnel looks to continue around a corner to the south and opens out into a wider chamber past a rusty iron grating to the north."]

["r102", "The tunnel makes a more-or-less right-angle turn here, continuing to both the north and the east. Water pools in the lower places of the uneven, mostly-natural floor."]

["r103", "The trickle of water past your feet is strong here, although not quite strong enough to be considered a \"flow\". Except for one heavily-reinforced area, the walls are almost entirely natural here. A small grating, set high in the ceiling of the reinforced area, admits both bright outdoor light and the occasional sound of traffic. To the west the tunnel turns northward; to the east it seems to being sloping upward."]

["r104", "The tunnel slopes distinctly upward to the east here. While the rock surface of the tunnel grows noticeably drier as the tunnel rises, the intensity of the trickle winding its way between the stones of the floor also increases."]
