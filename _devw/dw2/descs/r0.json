[ "r1", "The uniform dark brown of state facilities everywhere covers the interior joists, supports, and paneling of this dim picnic enclosure. Ripped screens in paneless windows permit entry to both the elements and a large portion of the insect population. A few rough wooden picnic tables sit upon the cracked concrete floor, and flapping screened doorways allow exit to both the north and south of the building."]

[ "r2", "You stand upon a flat expanse of well-kempt grass that stretches between the State Park facility to the south and the expanse of Lake Dunmore to the north. Seagulls wheel and cry above you, occasionally alighting on the turf to seek salvage and scraps. The the east sprouts a cluster of picnic tables, while the Green continues to the west." ]

[ "r4", "The well-kept expanse of grass beneath your feet separates a low State Park building to your south from the shore of Lake Dunmore to your north. The wide expanse of green also continues to your east."]

[ "r5", "A dozen weathered plank tables are strewn about the healthy grass here, providing surface for parties of parkgoers to lunch. A wide grassy swath stretches west of here; to the south you see some towering playground equipment."]

["r6", "A narrow strip of well-manicured grass clings to the south edge of the low, broad State Park facility building here. The other three sides of this small yard are bordered by a split-rail fence. You can enter the facility through tattered screen doors to the northeast or the northwest, or head east toward some towering playground equipment." ]

["r7", "A single mass of towring playground equipment dominates a bark-paved square which has been set off from the grass around it by what appear to be railroad ties. A few smaller pieces of equipment dot the area surrounding the main mass, like children or client kings. To the north you see some picnic tables scattered about, and a narrow strip of grass lies to the west."]
