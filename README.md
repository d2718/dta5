# `dta5`

This is a restart of the [`dta4`](https://github.com/d2718/dta4) project in [Go](https://golang.org). I love working in Lisp, but Go has a wonderful standard library and a united community (especially compared to Lisp!), and this particular project is right up Go's alley.

I'm not sure if this project will ever be intended for public consumption, but GiHub is the best centralized version control repository, so here it is. As of now, there is very little in the way of documentation, but some should materialize when evolution slows down. It'll run; I'll outline how when I'm sure the setup is more fixed.
